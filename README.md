# Eviction-Crisis-in-US-Counties
ANALYSIS OF EVICTION IN US COUNTIES

In 2016, there were almost 900, 000 evictions (renter ordered to leave), and over 2.35 million evictions filed by court. This statistic shows that the national wide average eviction rates and eviction filling rates in 2016 is about 2.34% and 6.12%. Considering that not all evictions make it to court or are officially documented by cities and counties, the actual eviction crisis should be even worse.

What is Eviction?
Definition 1:
 The act of forcing someone to leave somewhere, especially their home.
Situations like:
•	After falling behind with his mortgage payment, he now faces eviction from his home.
•	In this economically depressed area, evictions are common.
Definition 2:
The action of forcing someone to move out of a property.
Situations like:
•	If the property is sold for redevelopment, hundreds of residents could face eviction.
•	an eviction notice/order Several of the building's tenants received eviction notices after failing to renew their leases on time.


Problems with Evictions
-----------------------
Evictions cause lots of trouble for both the landlord and tenants, and even the neighbourhood, or the whole society.
The landlords usually won’t be able to collect the rent before the evictions, and after the evictions they may face a difficulty in finding good candidates for future tenants in a short amount of time. The tenants who get evicted may end up be homeless, and homeless situation usually causes poverty and even crimes, which would be a social problem.

Need For Analysis
-----------------
Here we can think of 3 P.O.V.s (Govt, Landlords and Tenants)
From the government’s point of view, it is beneficial to understand the causes of evictions, so laws can be made to regulate the eviction process and provide more assistance for those helpless tenants who got evicted.
From the real estate investors’ or landlord’s point of view, prediction of the eviction rates in a neighbourhood can help reduce potentially financial loss.
From the tenants’ point of view, prediction of the eviction rates in a neighbourhood would also help them find a more secured home: less chances of being evicted, and less chances of staying in a neighbourhood with potentially high crime rates.
